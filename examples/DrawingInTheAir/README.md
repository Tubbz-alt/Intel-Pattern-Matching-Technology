# Neural Network with Accelerometer Input Example
This sample is an application example for Intel Pattern Matching Technology. The sample sketch uses the built-in Accelerometer sensor inside the Curie module to detect motion. This data is used as an input to the PME to learn, recognize and classify the writing of alphabets in the air using the board as a stylus.

The Curie PME is initially trained using 4 training data sets for each letter of the first 6 alphabets A through F. A button is used to start and stop data aquisition in both the learning and recognition phases.
