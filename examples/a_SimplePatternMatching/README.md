# Neural Network Simple Pattern Matching Example

This example is for a simple pattern matching function implemented using the 
Intel Pattern Matching Technology Engine which is a hardware neural-network.



## Hardware Requirements

   Arduino/Genuino 101 or Farnell tinyTile board based on Intel Curie Compute Module.
   
   Appropriate USB Cable for Curie based board.

   No additonal hardware is needed for this example.

### Hardware Connections
   
   Connect the USB cable between the host machine and the Arduino/Genuino 101
   USB port or the tinyTile USB port
