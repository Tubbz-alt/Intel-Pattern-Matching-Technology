# Intel® Pattern Matching Technology

This repository contains the Intel Pattern Matching Library code that can run on the Pattern Matching Engine in the Intel® Curie™ Compute Module, which is used on the Arduino/Genuino 101 from Arduino and the tinyTile from Farnell.

## Development Environments

This library can be used in the following development environments:

* On Windows, Mac-OS or Linux, using Arduino IDE version 1.6.12 or greater and Corelibs 1.0.7 or greater.
* On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, using the latest version of the Curie Open Development Kit - Mixed Tree (CODK-M)
